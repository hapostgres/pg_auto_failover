 * Supervisor restart strategy.
 *
 * The idea is to restart processes that have failed, so that we can stay
 * available without external intervention. Sometimes though if the
 * configuration is wrong or the data directory damaged beyond repair or for
 * some reasons, the service can't be restarted.
 *
 * This strategy is inspired by http://erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html and
 * http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html#maximum-restart-intensity
 *
 *    If more than MaxR number of restarts occur in the last MaxT seconds, the
 *    supervisor terminates all the child processes and then itself. The
 *    termination reason for the supervisor itself in that case will be
 *    shutdown.
 *
 * SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_MAX_RETRY is MaxR, SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_MAX_TIME is MaxT.

 * retries and compare the oldest one with the current time to decide if we are
 * allowed to restart or now, applying MaxT.
