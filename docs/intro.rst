Introduction to pg_auto_failover
================================

pg_auto_failover is an extension for PostgreSQL that monitors and manages
failover for postgres clusters. It is optimised for simplicity and
correctness.

Single Standby Architecture
---------------------------

pg_auto_failover implements Business Continuity for your PostgreSQL
services. pg_auto_failover implements a single PostgreSQL service using
multiple nodes with automated failover, and automates PostgreSQL maintenance
operations in a way that guarantees availability of the service to its users
and applications.

To that end, pg_auto_failover uses three nodes (machines, servers) per PostgreSQL
service:

  - a PostgreSQL primary node,
  - a PostgreSQL secondary node, using Synchronous Hot Standby,
  - a pg_auto_failover Monitor node that acts both as a witness and an orchestrator.

The pg_auto_failover Monitor implements a state machine and relies on
in-core PostgreSQL facilities to deliver HA. For example. when the
*secondary* node is detected to be unavailable, or when its lag is reported
above a defined threshold (the default is 1 WAL files, or 16MB, see the
`pgautofailover.promote_wal_log_threshold` GUC on the pg_auto_failover
monitor), then the Monitor removes it from the `synchronous_standby_names`
setting on the *primary* node. Until the *secondary* is back to being
monitored healthy, failover and switchover operations are not allowed,
preventing data loss.

Multiple Standby Architecture
-----------------------------

In the pictured architecture, pg_auto_failover implements Business Continuity
and data availability by implementing a single PostgreSQL service using
multiple with automated failover and data redundancy. Even after losing any
Postgres node in a production system, this architecture maintains two copies of
the data on two different nodes.

When using more than one standby, different architectures can be achieved
with pg_auto_failover, depending on the objectives and trade-offs needed for
your production setup.

Multiple Standbys Architecture with 3 standby nodes, one async
--------------------------------------------------------------

When setting the three parameters above, it's possible to design very
different Postgres architectures for your production needs.

In this case, the system is setup with two standby nodes participating in
the replication quorum, allowing for ``number_sync_standbys = 1``. The
system always maintains a minimum of two copies of the data set: one on the
primary, another one on one on either node B or node D. Whenever we lose one
of those nodes, we can hold to this guarantee of two copies of the data set.

Adding to that, we have the standby server D which has been set up to not
participate in the replication quorum. Node D will not be found in the
``synchronous_standby_names`` list of nodes. Also, node D is set up in a way to
never be a candidate for failover, with ``candidate-priority = 0``.

This architecture would fit a situation where nodes A, B, and C are deployed
in the same data center or availability zone, and node D in another. Those
three nodes are set up to support the main production traffic and implement
high availability of both the Postgres service and the data set.

Node D might be set up for Business Continuity in case the first data center
is lost, or maybe for reporting the need for deployment on another
application domain.

Citus Architecture
------------------

pg_auto_failover implements Business Continuity for your Citus services.
pg_auto_failover implements a single Citus formation service using multiple
Citus nodes with automated failover, and automates PostgreSQL maintenance
operations in a way that guarantees availability of the service to its users
and applications.

In that case, pg_auto_failover knows how to orchestrate a Citus coordinator
failover and a Citus worker failover. A Citus worker failover can be
achieved with a very minimal downtime to the application, where during a
short time window SQL writes may error out.

In this figure we see a single standby node for each Citus node, coordinator
and workers. It is possible to implement more standby nodes, and even
read-only nodes for load balancing, see :ref:`citus_secondaries`.
