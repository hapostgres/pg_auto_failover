Description
-----------

The pg_autoctl tool is the client tool provided by pg_auto_failover to

Version
-------

To grab the version of pg_autoctl that you're using, use::

   pg_autoctl --version
   pg_autoctl version

A typical output would be::

  pg_autoctl version 1.4.2
  pg_autoctl extension version 1.4
  compiled with PostgreSQL 12.3 on x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42), 64-bit
  compatible with Postgres 10, 11, 12, and 13


The version is also available as a JSON document when using the ``--json`` option::

  pg_autoctl --version --json
  pg_autoctl version --json

A typical JSON output would be::

  {
      "pg_autoctl": "1.4.2",
      "pgautofailover": "1.4",
      "pg_major": "12",
      "pg_version": "12.3",
      "pg_version_str": "PostgreSQL 12.3 on x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42), 64-bit",
      "pg_version_num": 120003
  }

This is for version 1.4.2 of pg_auto_failover. This particular version of
the pg_autoctl client tool has been compiled using ``libpq`` for PostgreSQL
12.3 and is compatible with Postgres 10, 11, 12, and 13.

Environment
-----------

PG_AUTOCTL_DEBUG

  When this environment variable is set (to anything) then ``pg_autoctl``
  allows more commands. Use with care, this opens abilities to destroy your
  production clusters.
