pg_autoctl disable monitor
==========================

pg_autoctl disable monitor - Disable the monitor for this node

Synopsis
--------

It is possible to disable the pg_auto_failover monitor and enable it again
online in a running pg_autoctl Postgres node. The main use-cases where this
operation is useful is when the monitor node has to be replaced, either
after a full crash of the previous monitor node, of for migrating to a new
monitor node (hardware replacement, region or zone migration, etc).

::

   usage: pg_autoctl disable monitor  [ --pgdata --force ]

  --pgdata      path to data directory
  --force       force unregistering from the monitor

Options
-------

--pgdata

  Location of the Postgres node being managed locally. Defaults to the
  environment variable ``PGDATA``. Use ``--monitor`` to connect to a monitor
  from anywhere, rather than the monitor URI used by a local Postgres node
  managed with ``pg_autoctl``.

--force

  The ``--force`` covers the two following situations:

    1. By default, the command expects to be able to connect to the current
       monitor. When the current known monitor in the setup is not running
       anymore, use ``--force`` to skip this step.

    2. When ``pg_autoctl`` could connect to the monitor and the node is
       found there, this is normally an error that prevents from disabling
       the monitor. Using ``--force`` allows the command to drop the node
       from the monitor and continue with disabling the monitor.


Environment
-----------

PGDATA

  Postgres directory location. Can be used instead of the ``--pgdata``
  option.

PG_AUTOCTL_MONITOR

  Postgres URI to connect to the monitor node, can be used instead of the
  ``--monitor`` option.

XDG_CONFIG_HOME

  The pg_autoctl command stores its configuration files in the standard
  place XDG_CONFIG_HOME. See the `XDG Base Directory Specification`__.

XDG_DATA_HOME

  The pg_autoctl command stores its internal states files in the standard
  place XDG_DATA_HOME, which defaults to ``~/.local/share``. See the `XDG
  Base Directory Specification`__.
