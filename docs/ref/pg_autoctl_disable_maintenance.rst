pg_autoctl disable maintenance
==============================

pg_autoctl disable maintenance - Disable Postgres maintenance mode on this node

Synopsis
--------

A pg_auto_failover can be put to a maintenance state. The Postgres node is
then still registered to the monitor, and is known to be unreliable until
maintenance is disabled. A node in the maintenance state is not a candidate
for promotion.

Typical use of the maintenance state include Operating System or Postgres
reboot, e.g. when applying security upgrades.

::

   usage: pg_autoctl disable maintenance  [ --pgdata --allow-failover ]

  --pgdata      path to data directory

Options
-------

--pgdata

  Location of the Postgres node being managed locally. Defaults to the
  environment variable ``PGDATA``. Use ``--monitor`` to connect to a monitor
  from anywhere, rather than the monitor URI used by a local Postgres node
  managed with ``pg_autoctl``.

--formation

  Target formation where to disable secondary feature.

Environment
-----------

PGDATA

  Postgres directory location. Can be used instead of the ``--pgdata``
  option.

PG_AUTOCTL_MONITOR

  Postgres URI to connect to the monitor node, can be used instead of the
  ``--monitor`` option.

XDG_CONFIG_HOME

  The pg_autoctl command stores its configuration files in the standard
  place XDG_CONFIG_HOME. See the `XDG Base Directory Specification`__.
