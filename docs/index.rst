   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pg_auto_failover's documentation!
============================================

The pg_auto_failover project is an Open Source Software project. The
development happens at `https://github.com/citusdata/pg_auto_failover`__ and
is public: everyone is welcome to participate by opening issues or pull
requests, giving feedback, etc.

Remember that the first steps are to actually play with the pg_autoctl
command, then read the entire available documentation (after all, I took the
time to write it), and then to address the community in a kind and polite
way â€” the same way you would expect people to use when addressing you.

.. note::

   The development of pg_auto_failover has been driven by Citus Data, since
   then a team at Microsoft. The Citus Data team at Microsoft generously
   maintains the pg_auto_failover Open Source Software so that its users may
   continue using it in production.

   For enhancements, improvements, and new features, consider contributing
   to the project. Pull Requests are reviewed as part of the offered
   maintenance.

.. note::

   Assistance is provided as usual with Open Source projects, on a voluntary
   basis. If you need help to cook a patch, enhance the documentation, or
   even to use the software, you're welcome to ask questions and expect some
   level of free guidance.
