### pg_auto_failover v1.6.1 (July 7, 2021) ###

This release contains monitor schema changes, so the monitor extension gets
a version bump from 1.5 to 1.6, and this is the first release in the 1.6
series.

In this release we introduce a new state in the FSM: "dropped". This state
allows a node to realise it's been dropped from the monitor, and act
accordingly (mostly, stops cleanly and register it's been dropped).

This means that the command `pg_autoctl drop node` now only completes when
the node that is being dropped is still reachable. To drop a node that is
unreachable (e.g. machine died), you should now use the command `pg_autoctl
drop node --force`.

#### Added
* Feature crash recovery before pg_rewind (#656)
* Allow building pg_auto_failover with Postgres 14. (#716)
* Track nodes current timeline on the monitor and use it during election. (#730)
* Implement drop-at-a-distance semantics. (#734)
* Add the reported timeline id to the monitor events table. (#753)

#### Changed
* Fix how many nodes need to report their LSN to perform a failover. (#707)
* Allow an old primary node (demoted/catchingup) to join another election. (#727)
* Have pg_autoctl drop node command wait until the node has been removed. (#748)

#### Fixed
* Fix/consider timeline when reaching secondary (#695)
* Install btree_gist when upgrade to >= 1.4, not just 1.4. (#714)
* Fix a race condition issue around health check updates. (#720)
* Not all the monitor code got the memo about nodeid being a bigint. (#729)
* Use sysctl(3) on BSD (#733)
* Fix transaction begin failure handling (#751)
* Fix a connection leak at SIGINT. (#759)

### pg_auto_failover v1.5.2 (May 20, 2021) ###

This is a bugfix release for the v1.5 series.

In addition to bug fixes, this release also contains a lift of the
restriction to always have at least two nodes with a non-zero candidate
priority in a group. It is now possible to use pg_auto_failover and only
have manual failover.

If you're using the output from the command `pg_autoctl show settings
--json` please notice that we changed the JSON format we use in the output.
See #697 for details.

### pg_auto_failover v1.5.1 (March 24, 2021) ###

a version bump from 1.4 to 1.5, and this is the first release in the 1.5
series.

* Implement online enable/disable monitor support. [#591]
* Add individual pages for the pg_autoctl commands. [#632]

uri --formation monitor` now.

### pg_auto_failover v1.4.0 (September 23, 2020) ###

The main focus of this release is the new capability of pg_auto_failover to
manage any number of standby nodes, where it used to manage only a single
secondary before. This comes with new documentation coverage and Postgres
production architectures support.

The main changes of this release are:

  - A Postgres group allows any number of Postgres nodes, any of them can be
    setup to participate in the replication quorum (it's then a sync
    standby) or not (it's then an async standby).

  - Any node can be setup with a candidate priority of zero, and then a
    failover will never pick this node as the new primary. Two nodes with
    non-zero candidate priority are expected in any group, and the monitor
    enforces that.

  - The --nodename option is removed, replaced by the new option --hostname.

	At upgrade time your configuration file is migrated to the new format
    automatically.

    Adding to that, it is now possible to give names to your nodes. This
    change breaks scripts that you may have: replace --nodename with
    --hostname, add --name if needed.

    It is also possible to edit a node's metadata at runtime or when
    starting a node. The command `pg_autoctl run` now supports options
    `--name`, `--hostname`, and `--pgport`. That's useful in environments
    where IP addresses must be used and can change at each reboot.

  - The `pg_autoctl` process is now the parent process of Postgres.

    As of `pg_autoctl` 1.4 Postgres is running only when `pg_autoctl` is
    running. This simplifies systemd integration and allows a better upgrade
    process. It also makes `pg_autoctl` easier to run in containers.

  - It is possible to `pg_autoctl create postgres` when PGDATA is an already
    existing data_directory: as usual the monitor decides if that node is
    going to be a primary or a standby. All the Postgres nodes in the same
    group must have the same Postgres system identifer, and that is now
    enforced on the monitor.

* Allow multiple standbys in a Postgres group [#326]
* Allow adding a standby node from an exiting PGDATA directory [#276]
